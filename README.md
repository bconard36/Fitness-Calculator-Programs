# Fitness Calculator

This repository contains a **Fitness Calculator** program I originally wrote in **Python** and later expanded into a **web-based application** using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  

The calculator validates user input and computes key health and fitness metrics, including **BMI (Body Mass Index)**, **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**, and **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**.  

## Features

- **BMI Calculation** – Determines body mass index based on weight and height  
- **BMR Calculation** – Estimates daily calorie needs at rest (based on weight, height, age, and gender)  
- **TDEE Calculation** – Adjusts calorie needs based on user’s activity level  
- **Input validation** – Ensures user enters valid numbers and options  
- Two implementations:  
  - **Python (CLI-based)** – Runs in the terminal/IDE (e.g., PyCharm)  
  - **JavaScript (Web-based)** – Interactive webpage with HTML structure and CSS styling  

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3** – Original version, terminal-based  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Handles calculations and DOM interaction  
- **HTML5** – Provides structure for the webpage  
- **CSS3** – Styles the layout and user interface  

## Purpose

This project demonstrates my ability to:  
- Validate and process user input across multiple programming environments  
- Write modular functions for performing multiple calculations  
- Translate logic from **Python to JavaScript**  
- Develop a styled, responsive **webpage with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- Apply programming to a real-world, practical use case (fitness/health tracking)  

## Outcome

- Built first in Python as a programming extra credit project  
- Converted to JavaScript and expanded into a full **web application**  
- Successfully integrates **Python fundamentals** with **front-end web development skills**

**Note:**  
- The **Python version** runs in a terminal/IDE (PyCharm).  
- The **JavaScript version** can be viewed as a webpage (HTML + CSS + JS).
